</p>

<h3>Right to Data Portability</h3>
<p>
 You have the right to request that data, which we process based on your consent or in the fulfillment of a contract, be handed over to you or a third party in a commonly used, machine-readable format.

<p>
 You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data. You can contact us at any time to exercise this right. The right to restrict processing exists in the following cases:
</p>
<ul>

 If you contest the accuracy of your data stored with us, we generally need time to verify this. During the verification period, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data.
  </li>
  <li>
 If the processing of your data is unlawful, you may request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
  </li>
  <li>
 If we no longer need your data but you require it for the assertion, defense, or enforcement of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data instead of deletion.
  </li>
  <li>
 If you have objected to Art. 21(1) GDPR, a balancing of interests between yours and ours must be carried out. As long as it is not yet clear whose interests outweigh, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your data.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
 If you have restricted the processing of your data, these data – aside from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims, or to protect the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a member state.
